					<h4 class="mt-2"># Game Concept</h4>
					<p>Considering that this game project would be exhibited at Tokyo Game Show, we started by asking ourselves, 
					"What do we need to create a game that customers can enjoy as quickly as possible when they come to our booth?"</p>
					<p><b>The main points we took into consideration were:</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Game instructions should be short and easy to understand</li>
						<li>Playtime should be no more than 5 minutes</li>
						<li>Controls should be responsive and easy</li>
						<li>Multiplayer games offer good playability even with simple mechanics</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="mt-2">
					We decided on a 3D arena for multiplayer versus battles. 
					We chose the theme of psychokinesis because gun users are uninteresting and it's difficult to make a satisfying shooting mechanic. 
					Although we initially envisioned a first-person shooter (FPS), it's easier to see objects being held by psychics in a third-person shooter (TPS) view, so we moved in that direction. 
					And thus, <b>PSYCHIC SHOWDOWN</b> was born.

					<p>
					After the core game was complete, we enhanced the visuals by adding character animations, effects, new models, and shaders, which resulted in the look seen in the image above. 
					However, beyond just the visuals, we also worked on implementing more technically challenging features like online multiplayer, random map generation, and an item design algorithm.
